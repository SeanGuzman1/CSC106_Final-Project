Using GitHub, we will make sure that we have working code and a complete product that represents the best work that we can do with our current coding 
experience and through using different branches, optimizing the rate at which we figure out the most efficient code that that we can use for the final 
product. Using pull requests, we will make sure that the most efficient code is used in the master repository and that in each branch, any different 
choices made in developing the code are represented as to create a way to decide on the most efficient process that will eventually, after discussion, 
be merged into the master repo. This will create a good foundation for our project as we move on in complexity and develop more code that may not 
function well if there is not a good foundation on which it is built upon.
